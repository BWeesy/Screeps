Plan so far

Population Control
-Write a Spawner service
-Have efficient proportion of harvesters, upgraders and builders
-Have memory accuractely represent the living creeps
-Use the most efficient composition of creeps
-Improve naming convention

Targetting
-Write a targetting service - Done
-Target sources that are both full, close and about to reset
-Target buildings that are about to complete and close
-Targetting of room controllers can be dumb for now, but should be in same style as above for ease of change later. Will eventually want to stack room controllers
-Maybe use memory for targetting? Would keep the targets coherent, can pop off the stack once you know it's going to be fine. Maybe later.
